# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview and Purpose of the analysis

For the upcoming C_level presentation to V. Isualize two technical analysis and a written report has to be prepared. In the technical analysis a summary Data frame  of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph has to be created to show the weekly fares for each city type. 

Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary Data Frame by city type
Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis(README.md)


## Results

Below you can find the results and a description for the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

The table shows the results of the first technical analysis. 

- The total rides are in the urban cities with 1,625 the most and in the rural the less 125. That means an increase of 13 times. For suburban cities it's an increase of 5 times in comparison that the rural cities. 

- The total drivers are also increasing from rural cities to urban cities. In the urban cities with ... the most drivers are on the street. 

- The total fares is with 39,854.38 also in the urban cities the highest. 

- Due to the higher demand also more drivers are on the street. With that the Average Fare per ride is the lowest in urban cities ($24.53). It's the highest in rural areas with $34.62.  

- The same is for the average fare per driver. In rural areas the drivers are earning more per ride but have less rides in total.

## Summary

With bigger cities and higher population the total rides, total drivers and the total fares increase, but the average fare per ride and per driver decreases. Prices are usually driven by demand and supply. We see that in the urban areas are more driver than rider and so the averages fares a low. In suburban and rural areas are more riders than drivers, so the average fares are high. 

In general my recommendations to V.Isualize are the following:

- Recruit more drivers in rural and suburban areas
- Develop an app to organize the existing drivers. It should be possible to see where areas with higher demand are
- Develop and offer a car pool solution for urban cities
